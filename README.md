# Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems-Software-and-Development-Environments
My personal notes and programming assignments for the University of Colorado Boulder's "Introduction to embedded systems software and development environments" course on Coursera are stored in this repository. Eng. Alex Fosdick is the instructor for the course.

This course is focused on giving you real world coding experience and hands on project work with ARM based Microcontrollers.
